        <h1>Stoichiometry Calculator</h1>
        <h2>Welcome to my project!</h2>
        <p>This will eventually be a valuable stoichiometry calculator for chemistry students. But right now, we are working on the first step! This is focused on interpretting <br>
        I want to:<br><ul><li>Reject all inputs that are non-chemical</li><li>be able to retrieve information on valid molecules</li></ul></p>
        <p>as of now, it will reject and provide a proper error if you have entered a syntax issue, such as using h2o instead of H2O. In the future, I will acount for this, but for focusing on data retrieval and organization, users must enter proper capitalization for molecules</p>
        <p>but if you enter a properly capitalized molecule like, Na2CO3, an image of the molecule will appear at the bottom of the page</p>

            Dev Notes
        </h3>
        <p>the entire workflow from click-event to image propogating on the page is the result of 3 subsequent requests, 1 post and 2 get. I learned the basis of handling http requests efficiently through the use of async + await ES6 functionality.
            I learned to effectively pass the results of promises into other promises to reliably arrive at what I am interested in.
