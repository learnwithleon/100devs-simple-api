This website demonstrates skills learned in implementing APIs. It uses 3 APIs:
- one randomly grabs a trending anime and displays anime info
- one takes info from anime info and converts it to a nearby jewish holiday
- the third makes fireworks in the info section, activated by clicking the anime banner
